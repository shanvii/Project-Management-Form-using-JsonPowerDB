# Project-Management-Form-using-JsonPowerDB

**Title of the Project:**
Project Management Form 
That stores data in *PROJECT-TABLE* relation of *COLLEGE-DB* database  
*Input Fields:* {Project-ID, Project-Name, Assigned-To, Assignment-Date, Deadline}  
*Primary key:* Project ID


**Description:**
To create a project management form that stores data in the "PROJECT-TABLE" relation of the "COLLEGE-DB" database, with the following input fields:

Input Fields:
* Project ID (modified as primary key)
* Project Name
* Assigned-To
* Assignment-Date
* Deadline

Primary key: Project ID


**Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:**
* Simple and Easy-to-Use: JsonPowerDB follows a simple and intuitive schema-less model, allowing developers to store and retrieve data in a JSON-like format. This makes it easy to work with, especially for developers familiar with JSON.
* High Performance: JsonPowerDB is designed to deliver high performance with its patented indexing algorithm called PowerIndex. It provides faster response times for read and write operations, making it suitable for real-time applications and high-traffic scenarios.
* Inbuilt Search Engine: JsonPowerDB includes a built-in search engine that supports various search operations on the data stored in the database. This eliminates the need for external search engines, reducing complexity and improving efficiency.
* Multi-mode Database: JsonPowerDB supports multiple data models, including key-value, document, time-series, and graph models. This flexibility allows developers to choose the most suitable data model for their specific use cases, rather than being restricted to a single model.
* ACID Properties: JsonPowerDB ensures ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties for transactions, providing data integrity and reliability. It supports concurrent transactions and rollback capabilities, making it suitable for applications requiring transactional consistency.
* Real-time Replication: JsonPowerDB offers real-time data replication, enabling efficient data synchronization across multiple servers or data centers. This feature ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and disaster recovery capabilities for applications with demanding uptime requirements.
* Built-in REST API: JsonPowerDB provides a built-in REST API, allowing easy integration with various programming languages and platforms. Developers can interact with the database using simple HTTP requests, making it accessible and interoperable.
* Cost-effective: JsonPowerDB is designed to be resource-efficient, requiring minimal hardware resources compared to traditional databases. This can result in cost savings, especially in cloud-based deployments, where scaling resources can be expensive.
* NoSQL and SQL Support: JsonPowerDB combines the benefits of both NoSQL and SQL databases. It offers the simplicity and flexibility of NoSQL for unstructured data, while also providing SQL-like query capabilities for structured data retrieval, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
* Developer-friendly Environment: JsonPowerDB provides a developer-friendly environment with features like an embedded web-based development platform, interactive documentation, and code generation tools. This helps developers rapidly prototype, test, and deploy applications using JsonPowerDB.
